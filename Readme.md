# Hybrid Encryption Algorithm Roadmap/Plan

## Overview of Our Hybrid Algorithm

Our hybrid encryption algorithm processes data through three sequential layers, each providing unique security properties:

1. **Genetic Encryption (Layer 1)**
    - Encrypts input data using logical operations (XOR, XNOR, shifting)
    - Incorporates genetic processes (mapping to DNA structures)
    - Provides initial security through diffusion and confusion

2. **Homomorphic Encryption (Layer 2)**
    - Applies to data already encrypted by Layer 1
    - Enables computations on encrypted data without decryption
    - Critical for privacy preservation in cloud processing

3. **Adaptive Key Management (Layer 3)**
    - Manages encryption keys for both previous layers
    - Implements key rotation and time-limited access
    - Ensures long-term security and reduces key exposure risk

The final output is data that has been secured through all three layers, with each layer enhancing the overall security and functionality.

## Testing Strategy with Multiple Datasets

We will use three distinct datasets to test specific aspects of our algorithm:

### Plain Text Files (1MB to 16MB)
- **Purpose**: Measure overall performance metrics
- **Metrics**: Encryption time, CPU usage, memory consumption
- **Represents**: General cloud data (logs, documents)
- **Tests**: Complete algorithm performance (all layers)

### Wine Quality Dataset
- **Purpose**: Validate Layer 2 (homomorphic encryption)
- **Process**:
  1. Encrypt numerical data (pH, density) with Layer 1
  2. Apply homomorphic encryption (Layer 2)
  3. Perform computations (summation) on encrypted data
  4. Decrypt and verify results match unencrypted operations
- **Validates**: Ability to compute on encrypted data

### Healthcare Dataset
- **Purpose**: Test Layer 3 (adaptive key management)
- **Scenarios**:
  1. **Key Rotation**: Change keys periodically and verify continued access
  2. **Time-Limited Access**: Set key expiration and verify access denial after expiry
  3. **Attack Resistance**: Simulate brute-force attacks and measure resistance
- **Simulates**: Real-world sensitive data protection requirements

## Homomorphic Encryption Implementation Details

For Layer 2 implementation, we will:

1. First encrypt data with Layer 1 (genetic encryption)
2. Transform Layer 1 output to format compatible with homomorphic schemes
3. Apply homomorphic encryption using Microsoft SEAL library
4. Perform operations (e.g., summing encrypted numbers) without decryption
5. Decrypt and verify results match operations on unencrypted data

This approach is feasible but requires careful implementation to ensure Layer 1's output is compatible with homomorphic encryption schemes.

## Key Management Testing Approach

For Layer 3 testing with the healthcare dataset:

1. Encrypt data through all three layers
2. Simulate security scenarios:
    - Generate and rotate keys periodically
    - Implement time-based access restrictions
    - Test resistance against simulated attacks
3. Store keys securely in a simulated vault (representing real-world key management services)
4. Measure performance metrics during key operations

## Comparative Analysis

We will compare our hybrid approach against traditional algorithms (AES, RSA) by:

1. Testing all algorithms on identical datasets
2. Measuring encryption/decryption time, throughput, and resource usage
3. Evaluating security metrics like avalanche effect
4. Creating visualization of comparative performance

This comprehensive testing strategy will demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid encryption framework for enhancing data security in cloud computing environments.
